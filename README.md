In order to use to run the raw source code, you will need to have the javafx-sdk-23.0.1 or later to have the files run the JavaFX library + importing the java files to your project and configuring it.

The "src" will contain all the java files to run and build the application along with the compile. The rest of the files are .gitignores to avoid adding local project settings.
